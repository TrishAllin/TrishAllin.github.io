		<p>I had so much fun with this children's aesop fable "e-book". I love well drawn children's books (you could say I'm a snob when picking them out). I used a collage/textured shape design inspired from many authors including Eric Carle &amp; my son's favorite book at the time, "The Little Blue Truck". Just wish I had a little more money for the voiceovers (wink!). If it's any testament, my son used to ask to watch this over &amp; over, having no problem navigating or activating the animations of the book.</p>
