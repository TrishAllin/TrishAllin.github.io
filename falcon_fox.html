		<p class="portfolio-description">I attained a client looking to build an independent contract business for network security. They had no direction, content or ideas of what they wanted, &amp; no time to help provide it. With only a logo &amp; and a vague idea of what network security was and what they wanted to serve to their clients, I hand-wrote content, created new icon suites and graphics, and designed from wireframe to code. I am proud to say even with little to no direction, my clients are always pleased with the results, FalconFox being no exception!</p>
