		<p>During my tenure at Mike's Camera, I created &amp; edited the main website, digital &amp; social media graphic content. I was fortunate enough to be there for the launch of their new Colorado Photo Expo, the first &amp; only of its kind in Colorado. It would prove to be a large event &amp; we decided it needed its own site to highlight vendors, presenters, event information &amp; specials. I created the wireframes, mockups &amp; basic code framework in a matter of a few weeks. It was put on hold, then the trigger was pulled &amp; I was told they wanted it content &amp; all live within a week! I gathered, wrote &amp; coded all content, finalized design &amp; met the deadline. I also provided maintenance as more content was added &amp; edited. I created a new suite of icons, the expo logo &amp; the graphics from scratch with a bold new look while maintaining the company's main brand integrity.</p>
