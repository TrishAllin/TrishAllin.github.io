	<h2>n.io/niolabs</h2>
	<p>Oct 2016 – Jan 2018 &bull; Broomfield, CO</p>
	<h3>Front End UI Developer/Software Engineer</h3>
	<p>As a developer for niolabs I worked with front-end developers, backend nio software engineers, designers and hardware implementation specialists on multiple teams to create front end user interfaces for our distributed system, real time data software platform and the applications that consume it. I was also responsible for maintaining and iterating on our company website. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>Industrial Suite</span>
			<p>Connected various iot hardware with an Oracle database to take an entirely paperwork dependent industrial factory digital. We used a framework of React, Redux and Sass to connect the nio software with the database and hardware to streamline their process from product acceptance to billing. I was expressly involved in developing the UI which included displaying client work-order information, tracking of product completeness, flagging orders, and displaying data with graphs and dashboards.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>Digital Viticulture Platform & Deep Sky Vineyards</span>
			<p><a href="http://niolabs.com/product//case-studies/agriculture" target="_blank">learn more about the viticulture platform</a>
			<a href="http://ag.demo.niolabs.com/vineyards" target="_blank">Deep Sky Vineyard Experience</a>
			When I first came to nio, they had just completed the roll-out of a nio software, hardware and data connected vineyard with a dashboard UI called Deep Sky in Arizona. We wanted to make the platform commercially scalable, so in the vineyard’s off-season we re-factored the React/D3/Kefir/Sass based application to create a cleaner UI that uses Meteor, & MongoDB to securely manage, display and control the vineyard users and systems with a newly organized, streamlined data structure and updated React code base.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>niolabs System Designer &amp; Portal</span>
			<p><a href="http://niolabs.com/product/nio-system-designer" target="_blank">learn more about the system designer</a>
			<a href="http://app.n.io/signup" target="_blank">see the portal signup</a>
			Helped develop a signup/billing feature for the portal which uses a Laravel/PHP/Vue/Auth0 framework as well as small feature and bug fix implementations in the System Designer which uses a framework of  React/Redux/Saga/Auth0. I also updated and contributed to our hand-rolled  UI kit npm packages(nio-icons and react-nuik) which are consumed by all niolabs applications.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>niolabs website</span>
			<p><a href="http://niolabs.com" target="_blank">visit the site</a>
			Responsible for re-development/re-branding of the company site. niolabs is a Wordpress powered site  with a custom theme built on Bedrock, Sage and Origin SiteBuilder. I took highly custom designs from our design team and created templated pages, custom widgets and implemented plugins such as ContactForm7, MailChimp, Toolset, Permalink Manager and The SEO Framework. Upon rollout, I instructed and worked with key administrative team members on SEO optimization, blog building, copy changes, and widget usage to niolabs design standards.</p>

		<h2>DOOR TO DOOR ORGANICS, INC</h2>
		<p>Dec 2014 – May 2016 &bull; Louisville, CO</p>
		<h3>Front End Web Developer</h3>
		<p>As a designer/developer on the front-end team I helped maintain legacy content updates &amp; code while re-architecting &amp; re-designing our six separate location e-commerce sites in an Agile work environment with an emphasis on UI &amp; UX as well as business initiatives &amp; needs.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span>Agile Work Processes</span>
				<p>I attended daily scrums &amp; participated in, lead &amp; acted as scribe in retrospectives, planning &amp; grooming. I managed communications, workflow, ticketing system &amp; documentation with Slack, Google Suite (email, chat, drive, docs, etc.), JIRA &amp; Confluence software.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>Design &amp; UI/UX</span>
				<p>Worked with direction from the product owner’s communication of the business needs/initiatives &amp; integrated them with the front-end direction for site re-design &amp; re-architecture. Designs were created both independently &amp; collaboratively; starting with wireframes, then full mockups. As project lead, I would present &amp; explain design decisions to any cross-department &amp; team stakeholders throughout the design &amp; development process for feedback &amp; communication. In all phases I would make recommendations for user testing or request data from the UX Analyst then use all relevant feedback &amp; returned data to iterate on the designs to accommodate both the business &amp; benefit the user.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>Development</span>
				<p>Worked with the design team using Modernizer to hook onto classes, Grunt to create SVG fallback icons, automate code compiling &amp; minimizing, WURFL to detect devices along with a host of other tools, to maintain our legacy sites while developing new designs to replace pages &amp; sections of our site to be responsive, accessible &amp; mobile friendly. I did this implementing SASS, HTML5, grid structure &amp; breakpoints. All of this with ARIA Tabs/Roles, editing Coffeescript &amp; hooking into data brought in from ERP by the back end developers using JAVA in a Play Framework. As we started implementing new site framework we moved to a more maintainable Atomic Design based architecture using React Javascript Framework &amp; CJSX to hook into a newly created REST API brought in through Nuclear.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>Deployment</span>
				<p>In order to support &amp; stand by my code, I cross browser tested all work on actual devices as well as through Browserstack, &amp; created unit tests with Mocha &amp; shallow rendering for every piece. I worked closely with the Software Quality Assurance team to track &amp; fix bugs, create test cases as well as visually test the code pre &amp; post deployment on a bi-weekly schedule.</p>
