		<h1>Casey's Space Adventure</h1>
		<img src="../images/portfolio/csa-cover.jpg" alt="Casey's Space Adventure Cover" class="main-portfolio-image" /> 
		<p>This is my first attempt at a children's learning app. Casey's Space Adventure's main character is named &amp; modeled after my space fanatic son (he'll tell you he doesn't want to be an astronaut though- he wants to be a NASA engineer). It was a ton of research &amp; learning about not just the solar system but ActionScript as well.</br>There is a page for each planet plus the sun, black holes, asteroids, blast off, landing &amp; the solar system as a whole. Almost every page has multiple "play points"- learn about the planet, take a picture &amp; put it in your scrapbook, read part of Casey's story &amp; play a game.</p>
