		<h1>a little bit about me...</h1>
		<img src="../images/familypicture.jpg" alt="Photo of me and the kids" />
		<p>Hello there, friend! I'm Trish &amp; I am a graphic designer &amp; UX Engineer/Front End Developer with over 15 years of combined experience. I'm your quintessential Colorado girl living in the foothills of the Front Range &amp; there's no where else I'd rather be! </p>
		<p> I am the mother of two small children who married her college sweetheart &amp; our family loves to go on adventures! We are private rafters that love to float the river on our big purple raft. My husband &amp; I have rafted over ten rivers including the Colorado, Gunnison, Upper Taylor, Lake Fork, Dolores, San Juan, Desolation Canyon, the Headwaters of the Rio Grande &amp; the Yampa. Our kids have been rafting since they were three years old! We hike, love to camp, &amp; you can often find us riding our bikes on the Greenway- you'd know me anywhere by my Hello Kitty townie with hot pink flames! </p> 
		<p>I've been playing guitar since I was ten, &amp; my 12 string Ovation is my third baby. I love music of all kinds as evident by my vinyl collection which looks like it could belong to about five different people. I'm a fun &amp; positive person with a large base of useless trivia knowledge, an uncanny ability to name that tune &amp; recite song lyrics to music that was way before my time. I have a passion for animation, my favorites are Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, Disney &amp; Pixar. Being a leap year baby, that means my age is still in the single digits, giving me a great excuse to never have to grow up!</p>
		<p>Thanks for visiting, I hope you like what you see... feel free to contact me through LinkedIn if you'd like me to bring my skills &amp; talents your way!</p>

		<p>Yes, I am based in print design, but I LOVE to play in code &amp; think in divs- I believe that a solid print foundation makes for a better web designer. All of my sites are built with the client &amp; thier goals in mind, design to development starting with wireframing &amp; mockups, to copywriting &amp; artwork, markup, user &amp; cross-browswer testing and deployment.</p>

		<h1>motion</h1>
		<p>Animation has always been a passion of mine. While I have only scratched the surface of what I'd like to do with motion design (children's apps &amp; e-books?), here's a few little projects I've created or am in the process of finishing. While the great strides in HTML5, CSS &amp; JavaScript have all but made Flash obsolete, I truly enjoyed building these fun motion programs.</p>

		<h1>print</h1>
		<p>I've been a graphic designer for over 15 years &amp; if it's a print product, I've probably designed for it - magazines, newspapers, posters, large format signage &amp; vehilcle graphics. If it's a design/layout program, I've probably used it (yes, I well remember In-Design V1 &amp; before). The smell of fresh ink is simply amazing! When I can give a client something clever &amp; beautiful that they love that brings customers in, there's not much that makes me happier- except maybe the customer getting to hold it in their hand  &amp; enjoy my work.</p>
