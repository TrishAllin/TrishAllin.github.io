		<p class="portfolio-description">When I started at Door to Door, there was an older but pretty e-commerce site, &amp; in the background a full new responsive architecture, styleguide &amp; site design that was about half complete but waiting to roll. The orginal intention was to deploy the new site in one swoop, but business initiatives became priority &amp; we chose to slowly release pieces of the iteratively, creating what we lovingly called "Frankenstein". As we began making pieces of the site live, we realized we needed a javascript framework &amp; implemented React.js, a new atomic design based structure &amp; all while beginning the archetecture of a new RESTful API. </br> </br>The company had many clients with disabilities &amp; we made Accessibility to top priority in writing the code &amp; user tested both live &amp; A/B whenever we could. The result is a faster, more beautiful mobile friendly site, with a lush about section, more global &amp; rich navigation, &amp; an easy to use single-page signup. Add to that a sleek &amp; informational order sidebar, &amp; large, clean product cards with graceful, subtle animations that focus on the product &amp; purchasing easier &amp; clearer. The unit tests we created once React started to become implemented also helped us make our code more modular &amp; stable.</p>
