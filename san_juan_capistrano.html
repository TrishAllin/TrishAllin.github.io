		<h3>Watercolor &bull; 2003</h3> 
		<p>I was fortunate enough to travel and stay in San Juan Capistrano. I fell in love with the textures of the old archetcture, vibrant flowers &amp; lush vegetation. I documented the entire facility with hundreds of pictures, but loved the framework &amp; emotional feeling of this picture best, so I turned it into a watercolor study.</p>
