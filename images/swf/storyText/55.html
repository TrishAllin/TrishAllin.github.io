As Casey took off from Saturn, BAM! An asteroid, or minor planet, hit his space ship, rattling everthing inside and knocking him over. Just when he got to his feet and readjusted he saw a flash go by him, he shook his head and realized it was just a shooting star, also known as a meteor. He knew it was time to move along to his next destination, but first he stopped at a space station so he could readjust and make sure his ship was OK.
