Casey couldn't miss Jupiter, it was GINORMOUS! Often considered the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter also has at least 67 moons. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the sun. Casey could have stayed there all night exploring but he  wanted to be able to see all of the other planets.
