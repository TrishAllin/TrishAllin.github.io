When Casey pulled up to Mars it was soo cool, it looked just like a gigantic red bouncy ball. But after looking at it closer, Casey saw that it was orangish red. Mars is a Terresterial planet and similar to the Moon and Earth because it has craters, valleys, volcanoes and liquid which is often in the form of acid so Casey had to be super, duper careful.
