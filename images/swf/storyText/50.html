When Casey pulled up to Saturn, the second largest planet and sixth planet from the sun, it looked like he could step out on the rings around it, but the rings were actually made out of ice, rock, and stone and are constantly orbiting around Saturn making it impossible to stand on them. Casey found out that Saturn has 62 moons, 53 that are named and even has its own solar system, named Titan.
