<h2>Featured Event <br />
for September</h2>
    <h3> Crystal Lake Climb <br />
        Sept. 15, 2012</p>
    </h3>
    <p3>Join us on a spectacular 4x4 adventure up to the Crystal Lakes between Peak 10 and Mount Helen. We'll have a relaxing mountain afternoon at Lower Crystal Lake at the end of the jeep trail or you can hike up to the Upper Crystal Lake or Continental Falls. The hike is highly recommended with clear cut trails, creeks, old cabins and mines, but we won't blame you if you just want to relax and take in the scenery. Call for reservations.</p3>
