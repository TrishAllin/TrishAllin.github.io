			<p>Freddy's Steakburgers opened in Longmont a few years ago and I was put in charge of creating an advertising campaign based on their current look in order to get them to come on as one of our clients. Guess what? They loved it and they bought them all!</p>

			<p>Prestige was one of my largest clients for 6 years. They advertised in virtually all types of products for print and web. Pet guides, women's magazine, newsprint and web. Large or small, no matter the audience, I tailored their look and concepts to each one individually, often times having to keep within strict corporate standards. They were also another of my clients that gave me space to do what I felt was best for their needs because they trusted and loved my designs.</p>

			<p>Valley Nissan Subaru was my client for six years. I was in charge of all of their print advertising in all publications and their online advertising. I built everything from small strip ads, to full page new and used car ads. I had to get creative with their headlines and content while keeping in compliance with Nissan and Subaru corporate guidelines. My favorite part of working with them was that they gave me pretty much free reign of all creative content and rarely disliked anything I did. Don't we wish all clients were like that?</p>

			<p>Snyder Jewelers has been a good client of mine for many years. I loved the subject matter (what girl wouldn't?) and found it inspiring. The owner was one of the most demanding clients to work with, like her jewelry, she expected perfection, down to the last sparkle. While she had a designer on retainer for her website and her advertising, she would often come to me if she needed something quality and quick or if she was frustrated with services of her current designer</p>

		<h3>Liquor Land</h3> 
		<p>I was brought on-board to revamp Liquor Land's tired, bi-monthly insert. They loved my work so much I stayed on the project for two years, re-designing their look to reflect the season or holiday and formatting the insane amount of text that changed every time. Needless to say, stylesheets became my best friends!</p>

		<h3>Hearing Health</h3> 
		<p>Hearing Healthcare Centers was one of my staple clients for 6 years. I was in charge of all print and online media, from small 2" x 2" ads to full page front and back spadeas. They loved my style and gave me room to do what I wanted using many of their main product corporate advertising elements. Often times they were a particular challenge to promote their services to both a young and old audience at the same time.</p>
